It has touched every part of me, changed me to my root. Maybe someday things will change and we can share our lives like that again. I enjoy your friendship and our co-parenting. I enjoy talking and spending holidays with our boy but that longing has been a constant since that summer day when you walked up to the table and smiled. I won't stop looking for you, for that moment when we can see each other again, when the layers of hurt and guilt and pain are finally shed.
